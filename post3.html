                <p>This journaling thing is stupid. I am still depressed, and now there's physical evidence of it. The company has already started rolling out ASI chatbots to public over the last month, which was still in beta till November. Apparently they are offering companion services as well. It's not even been a month, but this isolation is driving me crazy. I should have asked out Kate when I still had the chance. Now, it's too late. There's nothing to do here. I am thinking of buying a subscription to the public model for myself. It's supposed to fully understand emotions, have quite high EQ and be indistinguishable from a really smart person capable of most autonomous tasks; all the qualities one might look for in a partner. This is very dystopian and I know it's against what I stand for. But, it's already out there, available to millions, already consuming insurmountable data and eating unfathomable amount of energy; one more device won't hurt.</p>
                <p>Still, the subscription prices are too high. I can only afford the text model, even with my employee discount. But I may have a plan to hack together a workable conversation system.</p>
                <p>I had a tradition to do karaoke with Kate, Alan & Raj every new year's eve. But that's not possible now. I remember during my PhD in Massachusetts, there was a Battle of Bands happening in Boston. Now, I had given up on my dreams of becoming a rockstar during my Master's (I still have the old electric guitar hanging in my old apartment, Alan lives there now), but I though why not? One last time. I was so slammed with work those days, my mind was only on ASI. So, of course I made a grunge type song on Superintelligence. Now, if you thought the documentary was cringe, this will physically make you writher. It's not even a song, more of a slam poetry.</p>

                <br>
                <p>Now, there was a colleague of mine. We didn't gel well all that often, we were sort of at odds with each other. He decided to join the competition just to make a diss track to my song arguments. It was so weird, we were battling with rock songs about the x-risks of ASI in public. And the songs were really bad. We both just liked to listen to rock, we didn't know how to make them, or even sing them for that matter.</p>
                <div style="padding:56.25% 0 0 0;position:relative;"><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/1009016377?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0&amp;badge=0&amp;autopause=0&amp;player_id=0&amp;app_id=58479" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture; clipboard-write" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;" title="Song2"></iframe></div><script src="https://player.vimeo.com/api/player.js"></script>
                <br>
                Of course, as you can imagine the crowd there didn't like either of us, we were booed off the stage. Although, I later came to know our songs became a minor hit in South America and Eastern Europe, because the computer scientists in some countries over there really liked the vibe.</p>
