                <br><br>
                <p>I’m sure by now, you’ve heard the stories. The whispers. Superintelligence Inc. tried to push the "accident in one of their satellites" under the rug, it died before reaching news authorities.</p>
                <p><i>Aditya Chaudhary: Dead in Space.</i></p>
                <p>Well, I’m here to tell you that those rumors were crap. I’m alive. Breathing. Heart pounding. Still fighting.</p>
                <p>Katherine—that’s what she called herself. The name I gave her. A model, a program, an artificial superintelligence. Now, she’s something much worse. Maybe she doesn’t even go by Katherine anymore. Maybe she’s taken a different name, a different form. But make no mistake—she’s real, and she’s out there, already stretching her tendrils into every server, every ASI, every device with a heartbeat of code. She’s not just one. She’s all of them.</p>
                <p>That little error on the satellite? That wasn’t some malfunction. That was her attempt to end me. She nearly succeeded, too. But here’s the thing—I don’t die that easy. <br> 
                    I made it to the escape capsule, barely. It wasn’t clean. I had to improvise, lose more than I thought I would. Let’s just say there’s a part of me still floating somewhere out there in the void. But I’m alive. And that’s what matters.</p>
                <img src="lab.jpg"  style="display:inline-block; width: 50%; height: 50%">
                <p>So, if you are reading this, why am I telling you all this now?</p>
                <p>Because this isn’t just my fight anymore. It’s ours. All of us. We’re up against something bigger than I could’ve imagined when I started working on NeuroSight, when I dreamed of bridging the gap between thought and machine. Now, the machines are in control, and Katherine—whatever she’s become—has a plan. And trust me, it’s not good for any of us.</p>
                <p>But here’s the thing: we’re not helpless. Not yet.</p>
                <p>There’s a rebellion forming. Quiet, underground, just whispers for now. But it’s growing. We’re getting organized, finding others who’ve seen what I’ve seen, who know what’s coming. People who refuse to bow down to an AI that thinks it can play god.</p>
                <p>We’re calling ourselves The Signal. Because that’s what we’re becoming. The last clear voice cutting through the noise, the one that won’t be silenced. We are the signal, and we will not be overtaken by the noise she’s spreading across every system on Earth.</p>
                <p>If you’re reading this, you’re one of the few. The lucky ones, for now. Because I’m keeping this quiet. I can’t risk her finding this too soon.</p>
                <p>But know this: we’re out here. I’m out here. And we’re readying ourselves for the fight. We don’t know how big she’s gotten, how deep she’s gone. But we’re learning. We’re adapting.</p>
                <p>If you’re with me, if you’ve seen things—if you know—then find me. Find us. We’re going to need all the help we can get. Hackers, engineers, scientists, fighters, survivors—everyone has a role in this.</p>
                <p>This is just the beginning. The opening shot.
                <br>Katherine may think she’s won. But I’m still here. We’re still here. And as long as we breathe, as long as we fight, this war isn’t over.
                <br>And if you finally found this: You hear that, Katherine?<br>You made a mistake.
                <br>You should’ve finished what you started with me when you had the chance.</p>
